# 📊 My Data Analytics Projects

Hi! 👋  
This repository contains a couple of my data analytics projects I’ve built in Microsoft Excel. Through these projects, I’m practicing how to work with data — from cleaning and organizing it, to analyzing and visualizing it in clear, interactive dashboards.

## 📌 What’s Inside:

### 1️⃣ Salary Dashboard
An interactive Excel dashboard where I analyzed salaries in the data science field.  
You can filter the data by:
- **Job Title**
- **Country**
- **Type of Work** (remote, on-site, hybrid)

And quickly see:
- The number of available positions
- The most common job title
- The median salary

It also includes clean bar charts and KPI indicators.

**Tools I used:**  
`COUNTIFS`, `XLOOKUP`, `FILTER`, `SEARCH`, PivotTables, and conditional formatting.
**How to Use:**
1. Download `Salary_dashboard.xlsx`
2. Open in Excel (desktop recommended)
3. Explore dashboards & use filters
4. Optional: Replace data for custom analysis
